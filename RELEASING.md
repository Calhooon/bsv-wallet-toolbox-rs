# Releasing bsv-wallet-toolbox-rs

1. Every change reaches `main` through a pull request; `main` is protected, admins included, linear history.
2. The PR merges (rebase-merge) once its four required checks are green: `Test Suite (ubuntu-latest, stable)`, `Clippy`, `Rustfmt`, `vectors`.
3. A release is a PR like any other: bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, add the `CHANGELOG.md` heading, merge it green.
4. Tag the merged commit on `main`: `git tag vX.Y.Z <sha> && git push origin vX.Y.Z` (the tag must equal `Cargo.toml`'s version).
5. The tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`: it checks the tag against the manifest and that the commit is on `main`, re-runs the CI jobs, then `cargo publish --dry-run` and `cargo publish`.
6. Nothing publishes from a laptop; no crates.io token is stored anywhere, in this repository or its secrets.
7. Publishing uses crates.io trusted publishing: the crate's Trusted Publishing setting names owner `Calhooon`, repository `bsv-wallet-toolbox-rs`, workflow `release.yml`, no environment.
8. A failed release job publishes nothing; fix through a PR, then the owner moves the tag to the fixed commit, or tags the next patch.
9. A published version is never re-published; a bad release is yanked on crates.io and superseded by the next patch.
10. Without the trusted-publishing setting on crates.io the publish step fails closed.
